# Classes

ES6 introduced a lovely thing called 'classes'.  
If you've never programmed before, they will make your life easy as you begin to learn interitance and OOP modeling in JS.  
If you've already learned how prototypes work in JS you may or may not want to use them, but you'll appreciate the abstraction they provide.  
If you come from a language with true classical inheritance, don't start here.  First learn pure prototypical inheritance then learn how classes work in JS. The name is very misleading, they work nothing like true classes.
